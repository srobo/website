      Student Robotics is governed by a Board of Trustees who are responsible for ensuring that we use our resources
      effectively to achieve our charitable goals. The way that we work is laid down in our <a
        href="{{ '/resources/governance/constitution.pdf' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">constitution</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Members play an important role in supporting the Board of Trustees, contributing to the organisation's strategic
      direction and holding the Trustees to account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trustees and Members are volunteers. All Student Robotics volunteers (past and present) are invited to apply to
      become a Member of the charity. Anyone who is interested in becoming a Trustee who has the interest, time and
      skills to make a meaningful contribution to managing the charity should <a
        href="mailto:{{ site.emails.trustees }}">get in touch</a>.
