          <p>
            We challenge teams of 16 to 18 year-olds to design, build and develop
            autonomous robots to compete in our annual competition. After announcing
            the year's game, we give teams six months to engineer their creations.
            We mentor teams throughout this time, as well as supply them with a kit
            which provides a framework they can build their robot around. Thanks to
            our sponsors, we provide this all for free to our teams.

        Student Robotics couldn't do what we do without the support of our
