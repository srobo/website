          Based in the UK, Student Robotics challenges teams of 16 to 19 year-olds to design, build and program
          fully autonomous robots to compete in our annual competition. After announcing
          the year's game, the teams have just six months to engineer their creations.
          As well as supplying teams with a kit, which they can use as a framework for
          their robot, we mentor the teams over this period. Thanks to the generosity
          of our sponsors, we provide all of this to our teams at no cost.

      <h2>Valuable skills for young people</h2>
      <p>
        Student Robotics primes participants for good careers in engineering.
        Working to assemble a team, build a robot, and then compete,
        participants gain invaluable technical and soft skills to help their
        future careers.

        <h3>Working as a team</h3>
        <p>
          For a team to succeed at Student Robotics, they need to work
          together. For many participants, this is the first time they have worked as part
          of a team. This practical experience is invaluable for their future careers.

          Without some serious code, even the most masterfully built robots
          can't do very much. With the help of our kit, teams will program
          their robot in Python to compete in the competition.

        <h3>Building a robot</h3>
        <p>
          There's nothing quite like building something and bringing it to
          life. Using our kit, teams will build a fully autonomous robot. The
          best teams pour their imagination into the design and the look of
          their robots.

          Student Robotics provided me with an opportunity to explore different engineering disciplines,
          from mechanical design, to electrical systems and software development.
          These insights to helped me to decide my next steps,
          joining the inaugural cohort at the Dyson Institute of Engineering and Technology,
          where I studied a degree apprenticeship with the University of Warwick alongside working on live projects.
          I’ve since joined Dyson fulltime, working in Upstream Robotics on mechatronic design.
