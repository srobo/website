The Student Robotics Virtual Competition is the first stage of the SR2024 competition. Teams will push their virtual robots to the limit, competing against each other in a [virtual arena](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/simulator/), teams are competing for real league points, which could make all the difference in the final competition.

Teams will have to submit their code to us by 6pm GMT on Thursday 7th March using our [code submitter](https://studentrobotics.org/code-submitter/).

After the livestream, teams will receive recordings of the matches their robot competed in and copies of their robot's logs.
