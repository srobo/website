[Challenge Days][tech-days] (formally known as Tech Days) are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on completing challenges with lots of help available. -- from a mix of long-experienced volunteers and more recent ex-competitors. They're also an opportunity to see how other teams are doing, get more direct help with your robots, discuss your strategy.

We provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as well as volunteers able to help you with your kits and hands-on guidance with your robots.

Spaces are limited to four teams, so be sure to [let us know][tech-day-signup]
