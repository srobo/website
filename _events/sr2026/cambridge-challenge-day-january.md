[Challenge Days][challenge-days] are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on completing challenges with live judging, quick feedback and the ability to iterate quickly -- assisted by a mix of long-experienced volunteers and more recent ex-competitors. They're also an opportunity to see how other teams are doing, get more direct help with your robots and discuss your strategy.

We provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as well as volunteers able to help you with your kits and hands-on guidance with your robots. If you're fail a challenge, we'll not only explain why, but support you in resubmitting.

Spaces are limited to twelve teams, so be sure to [let us know][challenge-day-signup]
by Friday 16th January 2026 if you'd like to attend. We will begin confirming
places from Wednesday 14th January 2026.

**Please bring your laptops**, along with any other tools or equipment you may need.
