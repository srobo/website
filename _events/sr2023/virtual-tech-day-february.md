Tech Days are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working on their
robot with lots of help available. Theyâ€™re also an opportunity to see how other
teams are doing or get more direct help with their robots.

With the second [Challenge Submission Deadline][deadline] on the same day, this
Tech Day provides an excellent opportunity for teams to work towards completing
the challenges and earn more early league points. In order to support this we
plan to mentors available right up to the submission deadline, so that everyone
has the best chance of success.

Teams are of course welcome to work on whatever they choose. As usual we'll also
be around to answer questions about the competition, give kit support, and
assist with your strategy ideas.

We see a strong correlation between teams who make early progress and attend
Tech Days and performance in the competition, so you are encouraged to attend
the Tech Day if they can.

Our SR2023 February Tech Day is being hosted on our [Discord](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/team_admin/discord) server.
