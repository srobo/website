Tech days are opportunities for teams to get help if you're struggling with a
technical issue, and is a controlled environment to make more progress on your
robots. It's also an opportunity to check out your competition, and share ideas
with other teams!

**If your team wants to attend, you need to bring your team leader or another
responsible adult. We also need their mobile number so we can contact them on
the day.**

**If the responsible adult is not your team leader, or your team leader has not
already sent James ([jroff@studentrobotics.org][mail-james]) their mobile number,
please do so before you arrive!**
