Tech days are opportunities for teams to get help if they're struggling with a technical issue, and is a controlled environment for students to make more progress on their robots. It's also an opportunity to see how well they're doing in comparison to other teams.

The Southampton tech days take advantage of the facilities of the University of Southampton, and usually involve a tour of the facilities.

## Directions

The location of our tech days are on a different campus to that of Kickstart, please check our map!
