Kickstart is the event which kicks off a competition year, where the game will
be announced and robotics kits will be handed out to the teams.

**Any team is welcome to attend the Southampton Kickstart, however you need to
let your local team co-ordinators know, as we will need to arrange for your
robotics kit to be at the venue.**
