The Student Robotics [Virtual League](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/robots_101/programme_structure#virtual-league) is the first stage of the SR2025 competition. Teams will push their virtual robots to the limit, competing against each other in a [virtual arena](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/simulator/), for real league points, which could make all the difference in the final competition.

Like for the in-person physical [competition]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/sr2025/competition/), which forms the culmination of the competition cycle, teams must devise a strategy which their [virtual robot](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/simulator/simulated_robot) can follow completely autonomously.
This is aided by the simulator using the same interfaces as the physical robots, enabling teams to write code which can largely be used for both parts of the competition.
Unlike their physical counterparts, the virtual robots come pre-designed and are the same for all teams.

This makes the virtual league both a test of the teams' coding ability as well as an early opportunity to explore strategies for competing against other teams.

Teams will have to submit their code to us by **6pm GMT on Thursday 6th February** using our [code submitter](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/tutorials/code_submitter).
Teams can make as many submissions as they like, with the last one before the submission deadline being used.

There will be four appearances per team in the Virtual League, with each Virtual League match being worth half a Main League match.
Only teams who submit code before the deadline will have appearances in the Virtual League.

After the livestream, teams will receive recordings of the matches their robot competed in and copies of their robot's logs.
