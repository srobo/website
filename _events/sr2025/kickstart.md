Kickstart is the event which kicks off a competition year. The structure of the
competition and the game rules will be announced and of course any questions you
have will be answered.

Throughout the day we'll have Blueshirts (our awesome volunteers!) around in
person, ready to answer any questions you may have and to help you through the
microgames. These microgames will help your team become familiar with the Kit
you've been provided and should kickstart some ideas for your robot's design.

We will also be live streaming the event for those unable to attend in person.

Registration for SR2025 has closed; places in the competition will be confirmed
in advance of Kickstart.

We have also prepared some [pre-Kickstart activities][pre-kickstart-activities]
to enable teams to start learning about robotics and our simulator right away.

Please [let us know][teams-contact] if your plans change regarding your
attendance at Kickstart.
