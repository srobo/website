Kickstart is the event which kicks off a competition year. The structure of the
competition, the game rules will be announced and of course any questions you
have will be answered.

Throughout the day we'll have Blueshirts (our awesome volunteers!) around in
person, ready to answer any questions you may have and to help you through the
microgames. These microgames will help your team become familiar with the Kit
you've been provided and should kickstart some ideas for your robot's design.

If you are unable to attend Kickstart, please [let us know][teams-contact].
