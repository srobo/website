[Tech Days][tech-days] are opportunities for teams to spend a whole day working
on their robot with lots of help available. They're also an opportunity to see
how other teams are doing or get more direct help with your robots.

We provide a space for you to work in, with power and internet access, as well
as volunteers able to help you with your kits and hands-on guidance with your
robots.

Spaces are limited to four teams, so be sure to [let us know][tech-day-signup]
by Friday 15th November 2024 if you'd like to attend. We will be allocating and
confirming places as we receive applications, so sign up soon to avoid
disappointment.

**Please bring your laptops!**
