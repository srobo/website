          <h3 class="text-center">Mentoring</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout the year, teams work to develop their robots. Mentors are
            on the front line with them. Working with one or two teams, mentors
            help teams keep teams on track, and help them find information they
            need to progress.

          <h3 class="text-center">Events</h3>
          <p>
            Kickstart, Tech Days, and the competition all depend on a small army
            of volunteers to run effectively. Whether it's shepherding teams,
            manning the help-desk, running reception, or orchestrating the
            matches; we're always eager for more Blueshirts.

          <h3 class="text-center">Development</h3>
          <p>
            Student Robotics relies heavily on an array of hardware and
            software. Aside from the kit which we lend to teams, there's
            plenty behind the scenes keeping things running, including this
            website! There's always room for more eyes to help us develop and
            maintain it all.

            After one kickstart event, I was hooked, and haven’t looked back since! After finishing college, I just had to become a Blueshirt, to help those like me realise their development potential too.
