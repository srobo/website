          Student Robotics is looking for new sponsors to help us fulfil our mission.
          The support from our sponsors will make it possible to sustain our programme
          and continue to run free to enter competitions that attract students from
          a wide range of schools and colleges. By partnering with us, you will be
          able to increase your organisation's or product's awareness with the next
          generation of engineers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every year, it costs us more than £20,000 to organise, support and run the competition, and we
          simply cannot do this without the help of sponsors.
        </p>
        <p>
          We could really use your help, and there are a number of sponsorship levels that are available.
          Please register to become a sponsor, and to help shape the future of these young engineers.

        <div class="column m-6-12">
          <p class="question">Who can sponsor?</p>
          <p>
            Any individual or organisation is able to sponsor Student Robotics.
          </p>
          <p class="question">Why do we need sponsors?</p>
          <p>
            We do not charge the teams to compete.
            However there are still costs associated in running the competition,
            and as such we depend upon commercial sponsors in order to keep
            running. Additionally, the robotics kits that are loaned to teams
            require ongoing maintenance and repairs. Thanks to our sponsors we
            are able to continue to offer this at no cost to the competitors.
          </p>
          <p class="question">Can I add Gift Aid to my donation?</p>
          <p>
            If you are a UK tax payer and eligible to give Gift Aid then you
            can add Gift Aid to your donation. Please donate through the
            JustGiving link above and after selecting your payment method tick
            the Gift Aid box.
          </p>
          <p class="question">How does sponsoring an award work?</p>
          <p>
            Each year we present 5 awards to teams based on their involvement
            throughout the year that are not based on the competition winners.
            Details of these awards can be found in the current <a
              href="https://studentrobotics.org/docs/rules">rulebook</a>.
            By sponsoring one of these awards we will add your company name and
            logo onto to trophy, and announce your company name when presenting
            the award.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you wish to suggest a new award, please email us using the form
            above and we can discuss options.
          </p>
          <p class="question">Can I donate services in kind?</p>
          <p>
            If you'd like to donate something other than money, please contact us
            and we will be happy to discuss how a partnership could work.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column m-6-12">
          <p class="question">How do I become a sponsor?</p>
          <p>
            Use the form above to get in touch.
            Please include a summary of who you are, what you're able to offer us and which level you have in mind.
            We'll contact you (usually within a few days) to work out the specifics and provide details for a bank transfer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alternatively, you can make a donation via our <a href="{{ site.links.donate }}">Just Giving page</a>.
          </p>
          <p class="question">How much can I sponsor?</p>
          <p>
            Any amount of sponsorship is welcome! No matter how small, several
            small donations from multiple donors do add up and can make a big
            difference.
          <p>
            However, unless you exceed the £500 for Bronze level sponsorship we
            are unable to do anything to directly recognise your donation.
          </p>
          <p class="question">How does setting a challenge work?</p>
          <p>
            You record a 5 minute video introducing yourself and describing the
            challenge, and provide a written description to be included in the
            rulebook. The video and rules will be released at the Kickstart
            event at the beginning of the competition and will be available online
            throughout the year.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of the competition the winner will be decided and
            announced. A representative of your company will be invited to help
            decide the winners and to present the award. The winner will
            ultimately be decided by Student Robotics, guided by your
            representative's input.
