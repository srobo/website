As you will be aware, the COVID-19 situation is quickly evolving, having recently been delcared a pandemic. Many large events are being cancelled and we want to be public about how we are responding to the latest news.

We currently intend to have the competition on the 18th and 19th April 2020 as planned, however are actively and carefully considering whether this needs to change. We will be contacting teams about our decision next week. We will also publish this on the Student Robotics website.

To improve transparency about the situation and what Student Robotics is doing, we've created a [COVID-19 updates page]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-19/).

If you or your school has any questions about our handling of the event, please don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:competition-team@studentrobotics.org).
