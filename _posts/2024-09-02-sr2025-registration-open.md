We're excited to announce that registration for the 2025 season of Student
Robotics is now open!

Based in the UK, Student Robotics challenges teams of 16 to 19 year-olds to
design, build and program fully autonomous robots to compete in our annual
competition. Teams will have just six months to engineer their creations. As
well as supplying teams with a kit, which they can use as a framework for their
robot, we mentor the teams over this period. Thanks to the generosity of our
sponsors, we provide all of this to our teams at no cost.

The competition cycle will start with an in-person [Kickstart event][kickstart]
hosted at the University of Southampton on October 12th. During the event the
game and the structure of the competition will be announced.

The competition year will culminate with an in-person competition over two days
around Easter 2025. This will see the robots compete through a league stage and
a seeded knockout. As usual the prizes will recognise not only the teams which
come top in the knockouts, but also those who excel in other ways.

Details of the game and prizes will be revealed at [Kickstart][kickstart].
Details of the competition events will be published when they are available.
We expect to confirm places towards the latter half of September.

If you would like a chance to [compete][compete] in Student Robotics 2025,
please fill in the [entry form][entry-form] with the required information.
Places are limited, so sign up soon to avoid disappointment.

We look forward to seeing your teams!
