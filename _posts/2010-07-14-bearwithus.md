  like to find out more about what's going on, why not read on.
title: Bear With Us, We're Working on it...

We thought it was about time the Student Robotics website had a complete revamp. It has been in development for a few 
weeks now, with most of the work being on the back-end. Apart from being more useful for every reader of the website, 
it has now become significantly easier for us &mdash; the guys that run SR &mdash; to make changes to the website. So, 
with any luck, the site will be updated more often.

Due to unforeseen circumstances, the site has become live a little before anticipated. Because of this, a large portion 
of the content is missing &mdash; well, not yet present.

The site is still a work in progress, so please bear with us. If, in the mean time, there is something you need to know 
and can't find out, please do not hesitate to [get in contact with us](/about/contactus).

That's all for now,

Come and visit us again soon,

Thanks,

&nbsp;

_The SR Team_
