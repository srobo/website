title: SR2012 off to a flying start
---
This academic year's Student Robotics competition, SR2012, is now fully launched.  24 teams of young people are now 
working to create autonomous robots to compete in this year's game: **Pirate Plunder**.

*Pirate Plunder* has considerably more scope for interesting robot activity than our previous games.  Autonomous robots 
will be racing to collect cube-shaped tokens, and get them back to the bucket in their home zone.  Robots can also steal
 each other's buckets, leading to an variety of possible tactics.  The full rules of the game can be found in our 
 [documentation pages](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/rules).

We've revamped our [API](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/programming) to be more powerful and work together with existing libraries more easily.
Our new libkoki-based vision system allows our competitor's robots to easily determine where they are in the arena.

We'll be here throughout the year providing teams with support both in person and through the [forums](https://studentrobotics.org/forum/).

*The SR Team*
