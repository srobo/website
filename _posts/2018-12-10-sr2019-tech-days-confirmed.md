title: Tech Days confirmed for SR2019
---

As was announced at Kickstart, we will be running some Tech Days during this
competition year.

Tech Days are opportunities for teams to make concentrated progress on their
robots with help from highly-experienced blueshirts. Theyâ€™re also an
opportunity to get technical help and to see how well teams are doing in
comparison to other teams. Later Tech Days may feature mockups of the arena,
enabling teams to test their robots in more realistic ways.

As with all other events, students *must* be accompanied by a responsible adult.

We will be running Tech Days at the University of Southampton on the following
Saturdays:

 * [15th December 2018][southampton-december-tech-day]
 * [9th February 2019][southampton-february-tech-day]
 * [9th March 2019][southampton-march-tech-day]

These Tech Days will be at the Highfield campus, start around 10am, and finish
around 5pm. However are free to attend for as much of that time as they would like.

We are also planning to run some Tech Days in London. If you would be interested
in a tech day in London too on these dates, please [let us know][teams-contact]
as soon as possible. For the December tech day, we need enough teams by
Wednesday 12th to make it happen.

We look forward to seeing your robots at our Tech Days!
