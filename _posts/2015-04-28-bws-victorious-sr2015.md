[Bishop Wordsworth's School][BWS] from Salisbury took 1st Place at this year's
Student Robotics tournament, held at Newbury Racecourse. In a tense final, their
robot "Underclocked Toaster" beat Team Aculeus of [Gordano School][GRD2], [King Edward VI Grammar School][KEG]
from Chelmsfold, MealsOnWheels of [Bristol Technology and Engineering Academy][BTE],
and [40 other teams from around the UK and Germany][teams-map] to take first
place. [Cranbrook School][CRB] from Kent took the Committee Award for their
simple and elegant circular robot.

Addressing all of the competitors before the prize-giving, Philip Su, director
of Facebook's London engineering office, said: "This has been an amazing thing
to witness; I love the ingenuity and the creativity, and I hope that you
continue to choose the path that you're on.

> I wish I had opportunities like this when I was younger, because I was an
> engineer at heart when I was young, and I often felt made fun of. I felt
> outcast. But this is the thing you find out after you graduate from Uni, and
> you can trust me on this: that image of engineering is wrong. It turns out you
> are Tony Stark. It turns out you are Tris Prior. You are divergent, but you're
> also erudite, and you're dauntless, and you will rule the world. I promise you
> this: pursue the thing that you love, and you will one day rule the world.

Student Robotics 2015 was the first to feature only new-generation kit, with USB
Servo and Power Boards, and a Brain Board based on the ODROID U3. The
competition has now been running for eight years, and remains free for teams to
enter thanks to our sponsors and [many volunteers][volunteer].

## The challenge: *Capture the Flag*

For this year's game, the competitors had to build and program
robots to capture and keep as many flags (large wooden cubes on castors) as
possible within the three-minute games. Full details can be found in the
[rulebook][].

The standard remained high this year, with a wide variety of approaches. Many
teams chose to gamble on speed, dashing for the centre flag, bringing it back to
their zone, and guarding it for the rest of the match. Others chose a more
flexible approach, using their vision systems to adapt to the situation, often
attempting to steal flags from their rivals. [King Edward VI Grammar School][KEG]'s
approach was to drive slowly but carefully, a strategy which paid off, winning
them 3rd Place and the Rookie Award.

## Prizes

Winning the knockout is not the only prize-worthy achievement at Student
Robotics. A complete list of prizes is shown below:

| 3rd Place             | [King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford][KEG]
| Committee Award       | [Cranbrook School][CRB]
| Rookie Award          | [King Edward VI Grammar School, Chelmsford][KEG]
| First Robot Movement  | [CATS Robotics][CAT] ([video](http://youtu.be/NP0rywgydNw))

The *Committee Award*, given for a simple and elegant solution to the year's
challenge, was awarded to [Cranbrook School][CRB]. The committee was impressed
by their simple but effective circular design, which had no need for moving
parts except for its two drive wheels.

The *Rookie Award* is for the rookie team who performed best in the knockouts.
The *First Movement Award* is given to the first rookie team to demonstrate a
moving robot.

The *Robot and Team Image* prize is for the team which present themselves and
their robot in the most outstanding and stylish manner. The winners this year,
"42 * 2 - Double Vision" from [Gymnasium Markt Indersdorf][MAI], came dressed as
monks in hooded brown robes, laced with glowing LED strips. Hoods were a major
theme this year, with [Systemetric][HRS] from [Hills Road Sixth Form College](http://www.hillsroad.ac.uk)
dressing as sinister black-cloaked "Aluminati".

The *Online Presence* award is given to the team with the best website, social
media presence, or combination of the two.

For full details of the awards, please see the [rulebook][].

## The teams

44 teams made it to the competition this year, 20 of whom came from schools or
colleges which had not competed before.

Student Robotics 2016 promises to be the biggest and best yet. If you'd like to
compete, see [the Compete page][compete] for more
information. Start talking to your teachers and recruiting team members as soon
as possible!

## Notes to editors

Student Robotics is an annual robotics competition for 16-18 year-olds in the UK
and Europe. It was founded in 2006 by university students and is free to enter
thanks to our sponsors and [many volunteers][volunteer].
Since it was first run in 2008, the final competition has grown from one room at
the University of Southampton[^1] to a two-day event for 54 teams and over 400
students.

[^1]: 1\. Student Robotics is independent from the University of Southampton.

At the start of the academic year, teams are given a kit containing custom-made
electronics at a Kickstart event, where the game for the year is announced. They
then have until the end of the Easter holiday to build fully-autonomous robots
which will compete against each other in the final competition. They are
supported by volunteer mentors, and software to assist them in programming their
robots is provided.

High resolution photographs of the event will be uploaded to [the Flickr group](https://www.flickr.com/groups/sr2015).
