Student Robotics is over for another year! After almost six months of work by thirty-two teams came a final weekend of 
frantic building, coding and pizza consumption. Oh, and the small matter of a 102-match league tournament topped with a 
knockout competition to decide the winner, which needed a tie-breaker to resolve!

This year's game was called "A Strange Game". To score points, a robot had to claim squares of a 3x3 grid by placing 
more tokens in them than its opponents, or by lifting one of its tokens onto a pedestal. Score multipliers were applied 
for claiming a row or column.

The main mechanisms for transporting tokens were grabbing arms and suction cups. Many robots focused on getting tokens 
into the square right in front of them. Several tokens were successfully placed on pedestals; team Gymnasium Markt
Indersdorf, from Munich, managed to get four tokens onto separate pedestals during one match. Amongst the competing
robots were a hovercraft, a cow, a stag beetle, WALL&middot;E and Superman.

The final was a very close game, which ended with a three way tie. It was quickly decided that a tie breaker match had 
to occur between Clifton High School, Gymnasium Markt Indersdorf and Queen Mary's College.

The tie breaker was also a very, very close game. Clifton High claimed their closest zone before getting stuck; 
meanwhile Markt Indersdorf and QMC were having a pedestal race. Markt Indersdorf managed to miss their second pedestal, 
knocked the token into the zone they'd already claimed and became stuck, while QMC managed to successfully claim their 
second pedestal. However Gymnasium Markt Indersdorf's robot had not given up, and managed to get a token and line up for
 its third attempt at claiming a pedestal -- the one which QMC had already claimed.

Within the last 5 seconds of the match, Markt Indersdorf's scissor lift slowly rose skywards to tumultuous applause, 
lifting their token above QMC's and onto the pedestal, usurping the square from QMC. Not only was this a first for the 
competition, but it won them the game and first place.
