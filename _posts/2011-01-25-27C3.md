Robert Spanton, one of the founding members of Student Robotics, gave
[a talk about SR](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2010/Fahrplan/events/4175.en.html) at
[27C3](http://events.ccc.de/congress/2010/wiki/Welcome). In the talk, Rob discusses the motivation behind SR, what SR is
 currently doing and is planning to do, and gives a technical overview of the hardware and software we provide.

A [video of the talk](http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2010/27c3-4175-en-from_robot_to_robot.html) is available
directly from the CCC website, and Rob has made [his slides](http://xgoat.com/wp/wp-content/2010/12/robot-to-robot.pdf)
available in PDF form on his blog.

27C3 was the 27th Chaos Communication Congress, held in Berlin from December 27 to December 30, and is one of the
largest international hacker meetings.
