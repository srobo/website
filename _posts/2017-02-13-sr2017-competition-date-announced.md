We are pleased to announce the details of the 2017 Student Robotics competition!

The competition is the grand finale of our competition programme, where our teams
all come together for two days of hurried tinkering and matches. For many, it's
about fielding their creations and putting them to the test. For the most
successful teams, glory and prizes await.

The competition will be held on the 1st and 2nd of April, at Newbury Racecourse.

Teams will be notified of how they can acquire tickets in the coming days. As
usual, this will require attendees to fill out a media consent form.

For more information, please see the competition [event page][competition-event].

See you there!
