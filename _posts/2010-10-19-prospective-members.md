title: Students' Welcome Doing
---
[Doings](https://www.studentrobotics.org/trac/wiki/Doings) are so called because we like to actually realise projects 
during our weekly get-togethers. In the coming days we've organised some introductory activities that are ideal for 
University Students who want to get involved in Student Robotics for the first time.

Everyone is welcome, regardless of previous experience or field of study - just bring some enthusiasm and an open mind 
and we'll bring the cake!

During these doings we'll present what Student Robotics is, some of the technologies we use and some of the projects 
that you can get involved in with a series of lightning talks. We'll also head to a pub for dinner at some point during 
the evening.

University of Southampton
:	5pm - 10pm, Wednesday 20th October, Zepler Seminar Room 1. Straight across from reception in 
[Building 59](http://www.soton.ac.uk/about/whereissoton/maps/Highfield%20Campus%203D%20&%20Key%20OCT2010%20WEB.pdf)

Bristol University

If you can't come along at 5pm or are otherwise committed on Wednesday evenings you can still get involved! 
[Get in touch](/about/contactus) and we'll do our best to introduce you to SR and find out how you can get involved in 
SR projects.

See you there!
