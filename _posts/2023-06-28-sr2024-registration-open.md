We're excited to announce that registration for the 2024 season of Student
Robotics is now open!

Based in the UK, Student Robotics challenges teams of 16 to 19 year-olds to
design, build and program fully autonomous robots to compete in our annual
competition. Teams will have just six months to engineer their creations. As
well as supplying teams with a kit, which they can use as a framework for their
robot, we mentor the teams over this period. Thanks to the generosity of our
sponsors, we provide all of this to our teams at no cost.

The competition cycle will start with a live streamed
[Kickstart event][kickstart] on our YouTube Channel. During the event the game
and the structure of the competition will be announced and kits handed
out to teams.

The competition year will culminate in an in-person competition over two days in
around Easter 2024, which will see the robots compete through a league stage and
a seeded knockout. As usual the prizes will recognise not only the teams which
come top in the knockouts, but also those who excel in other ways.

Details of the game and prizes will be revealed at Kickstart. Details of the
Kickstart and competition events will be published when they are available.
We expect to confirm places towards the end of September.

If you would like a chance to [compete][compete] in Student Robotics 2024,
please fill in the [entry form][entry-form] with the required information.
Places are limited, so sign up soon to avoid disappointment.

We look forward to seeing your teams!
