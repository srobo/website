Student Robotics 2011 is over!  After much hard work, hacking, and bodging, fifteen teams from thirteen UK schools 
across five counties, and two countries came together to pit their robotic creations in a titanic battle of wits.

Each team had to build a robot that could navigate a course littered with other robots and red beans cans which could be
 collected to gain points.
Further points could be scored by completing sections of the course,
 and extra points were available to robots that made it over the ramp.
The robots used a number of sensing mechanisms,
 from the provided vision system
 (which was impressively used for more than just looking forwards)
 to various implementations of distance sensors.

The day comprised a gruelling 32 match league stage provided seeding for the later knock-out stage that would determine 
the winners of Student Robotics 2011.
Congratulations to all the competitors, whatever place achieved,
 we hope that you've all had fun & learnt something along the way.
